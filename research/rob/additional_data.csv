" The psychometric test was thrilled by identifying potential sources of bias which, in addition to data set accuracy and completeness could be improved.

Other sectors with large-scale talent acquisition can also benefit from this technology. Imagine that all applicants had video recorded on their mobile devices an environment with a minimum quality standard (lighting can be crucial) and could upload these videos as mandatory application elements and then analyze them using AI tools during recruitment processes. In conclusion, our services are designed to support humanism within the psychometrics – reducing biases during recruitment processes. The goal is to provide high levels of predictive capabilities and rich information on personality traits.Psychometricians must be aware of all the different biases while conducting tests and the risks they might bring upon the process before taking any further actions21=2-1; which it is analyzed stages measured information state resistance bias both specific methods providers limitations25 .

Important insights can be gained, for example, by observing a drop in performance due to putting too much emphasis on maximize revenue as opposed to balancing quality against revenue (Heeren et al., 2015). Against this background, some training providers never seem to get their customers fully motivated for training because their sales teams overemphasize revenue maximization. 3 Observations on implementation The following table shows the identified common success tool features from a data-driven enterprise perspective.

The IBM Watson AI platform is very efficient in analyzing data and extracting useful information from it. In this case, the platform has been used to predict personnel fluctuations within a company. The algorithm takes into account several factors that are known to be associated with potential staff turnover. These factors include the time between promotions, the total number of working hours (including overtime and commuting), as well as differences in salaries and bonuses within the company.

The platform is able to achieve an accuracy of 95% in its predictions, which is a very high rate. This is due to the fact that IBM Watson is able to effectively analyze large amounts of data and extract the relevant information from it."

Recently published online in the journal, PLOS ONE is a brief report that explores these challenges and proposes a solution for their assessment: a novel algorithm, HireVue's Analytics Suite.

With this technology we use millions of videos of job applicants from different sectors during the recruitment process. In order to implement the algorithm it was needed two years of work by more than 50 people. Evidence from studies using large samples demonstrate that the perception of key behaviors (such as motivation or leadership) expressed by video has greater correlation with an objective measure (predictors of outcomes most relevant to employers) than those collected through conventional means ( self-evaluation questionnaires or self-presentation interviews). Therefore, it is possible to offer a range of new insights about what drives employee performance and inspire innovative ways for organizations to be much more effective when developing programs focused on improving organizational culture and business outcomes.","

## 2. Methods
### 2.1 Data Collection
The dataset used in this project can be found in Kaggle's website (https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-for-good-city-of-los-angeles/data). It includes job postings data from multiple sources, including Indeed, Careerjet, Glassdoor etc. The data is scraped on a regular basis to keep it up to date. 


### 2.2 Data Reduction and Transformation
The collected data needed to be reduced and transformed in order to be analyzed. Therefore, the following steps were performed:
* The useless columns were dropped;  
* The duplicated rows were removed;  
* The columns with more than 50% missing values were dropped;  
* The categorical variables were converted into dummy variables;  


### 2.3 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

2) Virtual customer assistants: 
We are all familiar with voice-controlled virtual assistants in our homes, such as Amazon Echo or Google Home. Voice assistants are making their way into the business world too and becoming more ubiquitous. They can be used to increase customer engagement, reduce support costs and ultimately improve customer satisfaction. AI-powered chatbots or virtual customer assistants use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand human interactions and carry out conversations accordingly.

3) Product recommendations: 
This is one of the most commonly used applications of AI in eCommerce. Based on a customer’s past interactions, purchases and browsing behavior, product recommendations can be made to them in real-time. This not only increases the chances of upselling and cross-selling but also helps customers find products they might be interested in, but would not have otherwise considered.

A number of companies has already started to use thisauthentication technology. For example, legitimate: financial and telecommunications firms – customers are welcome to authenticate using their voices instead of a PIN or password and cover a greater range of interactions. Voice Biometrics can now also be used for multi-modal identification by combining it with other types of data such as fingerprint and iris recognition.
 
In its Customer Authentication report, Juniper Research indicates that companies see tremendoussaves potential: in terms of accountability inside (and thus possible liability) by adopting stronger authentication methods such as voice biometrics ahead. After third party breaches totaled $ 372 billion: in 2018, the focus is on eliminating Points of Vulnerability in processes ranging from application to productoriented manufacturing inside, says Steffen Eger, author: the new Juniper research reports. User experience must also be given aesthetic attention so that strong authentication does not have negative impacts on brand reputationparameters related to CX Inside."," The main advantage of this solution is that the test serves as a factor in identifying two and as a production object authentication method. Several companies now offer full solutions for call or SMS authentication in all markets, speaking exclusively to voice languages. Most bank systems are now using soundproofer "
"

The expanded biometry solution was launched in the IVR, where it works seamlessly – now only new customers can call directly, who receive authentication text messages via their mobile phones before they call. Existing clients who have successfully authenticated so far at Agent: inside are transferred to a convenient customer service agent on the same line. This solution improves the overall customer experience of users, as well as its own efficiency by providing easy access to quick service 24/7 – whereas agents don’t spend valuable time on trying to authenticate every caller anymore either…

In addition to improving customer service and risk management, Fidelity plans to leverage this technology for new applications with clients: on the inside too. In response to recent changes in European banking laws regarding Anti Money Laundering (AML) compliance limits for money laundering, the institution introduced PEP checking services for customers on a self-service basis with its enhanced IVR without human intervention. All sending transactions must be verified by manually completing documentation with an Authentication Verifier Client – Which is expensive and not very efficient compared with using automatic biometrics authentication via IVR. By leveraging a cognitive artificial intelligence program that understands natural human interaction (something Fidelity has been doing since 2016) Engine: Inside also actively uses chatbots","

We all know how frustrating it is to remember a password, especially a long and complicated one. It's also easy to accidentally type in the wrong password or have someone else use our device and access our accounts. This is where voice biometrics can help. Voice biometrics uses the unique characteristics of a person's voice to verify their identity. This means that it is much harder for someone to impersonate you and gain access to your account. Voice biometrics is also much quicker and more convenient than other methods of authentication such as entering a one-time passcode. This makes it ideal for use in call centers, mobile applications, chatbots, and physical access control systems."," But each mobile caller who cl Chesterfield sofa by Winston Porter are Furniture designed for your modern home.

Since Francis Fraudmarque’s: fraudulent inside text provides a longer expression of language, it improves agent performance on the first call by match-checking recordings against models independent of automatic speech recognition (ASR). It also helps prevent fraudsters from purchasing more than one time authorization numbers (PINs), which they use to impersonate bank clients. After the PIN is entered in the IVR, the recording machine is generated internally using its own voice base model based on a proprietary algorithm and comparing these recordings with quality measures such as forcefulness, pitch range etc. followed by overlay features such as repetition of IP addresses and SN numbers rhythms etc..
